# LoanClub - Loan Credit Risk Prediction

This is my internship project as a data scientist at [id/x partners](https://idxpartners.com/)
<br><br>

In this project, I designed a predictive model to determine the probability that loan borrowers will have a good or bad (risky) loan status at a lending company with **98% accuracy**.
<br><br>

Note: This project is still on-going, will update later.

## Project Notebooks

I create separated notebooks due to my limited computing resources
- [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/adhang/learn-data-science/blob/main/LendingClub_Loan_Credit_EDA.ipynb)
- [Modeling](https://github.com/adhang/learn-data-science/blob/main/LendingClub_Loan_Credit.ipynb)

## Dataset & Business Understanding

**Dataset Information**
- This dataset contains borrowers information from a lending company, named [LendingClub](https://www.lendingclub.com/) (LC for short) from 2007 to 2014
- This company has various offerings such as borrowing, banking, and investing
<br><br>

**Attribute Information**
- Identifier
	- `id` - A unique LC assigned ID for the loan listing
	- `member_id` - A unique LC assigned ID for the borrower member

- Target Variable
	- `loan_status` - Current status of the loan, whether it's a good or bad (risky)

- More detailed attribute information can be found [here](https://resources.lendingclub.com/LCDataDictionary.xlsx)
