# LoanClub - Loan Credit Risk Prediction

This is my internship project as a data scientist at [id/x partners](https://idxpartners.com/)
<br><br>

In this project, I designed a predictive model to determine the probability that loan borrowers will have a bad (risk) or good loan status at a lending company.
<br><br>

Note: This project is still on-going, will update later.

## Project Notebooks

I create separated notebooks due to my limited computing resources

- [Modeling](https://github.com/adhang/learn-data-science/blob/main/LendingClub_Loan_Credit.ipynb)
